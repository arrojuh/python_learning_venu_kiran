1. Print Multiples of a Number
Write a program that prints all multiples of 3 between 1 and 50 using a `for` loop.

2. Sum of Elements in a List
Given a list of numbers, write a `for` loop to calculate and print the sum of all the elements.
Example Input:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output:
Sum: 15

3. Reverse a String
Write a program to reverse a string using a `for` loop.
Example Input:
text = "Python"
Output:
"nohtyP"

4. Find the Largest Number
Given a list of integers, use a `for` loop to find and print the largest number in the list.
Example Input:
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 5, 40]
Output:
Largest: 40

5. Count Vowels in a String
Write a `for` loop to count the number of vowels in a given string.
Example Input:
text = "hello world"
Output:
Vowel count: 3

6. Factorial Calculation
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop.
Example Input:
n = 5
Output:
Factorial: 120

7. Find Common Elements
Write a `for` loop to find the common elements between two lists.
Example Input:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output:
Common elements: [3, 4, 5]

8. Generate a Number Pyramid
Write a program to generate a pyramid of numbers based on user input.
Example Input:
n = 4
Output:
1
12
123
1234

9. Check for Palindromes
Write a program to check if each word in a given list is a palindrome using a `for` loop.
Example Input:
words = ["madam", "python", "racecar", "hello"]
Output:
madam: True
python: False
racecar: True
hello: False

10. FizzBuzz
Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem: Print numbers from 1 to 50, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5 print "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz."
Output:
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, ...
