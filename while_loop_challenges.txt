1. Print Numbers from 1 to 10
Write a program using a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

2. Sum of Numbers Until Zero
Write a program that continuously takes user input and adds the numbers until the user enters 0. Use a `while` loop.
Example Input:
5, 3, -2, 0
Output:
Sum: 6

3. Reverse a String
Write a program to reverse a string using a `while` loop.
Example Input:
text = "Python"
Output:
"nohtyP"

4. Guess the Number Game
Implement a game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess it. Keep prompting until the guess is correct.

5. Count Down Timer
Write a `while` loop to implement a countdown timer from a given number to 0.
Example Input:
n = 5
Output:
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0

6. Find the First Negative Number
Given a list of numbers, use a `while` loop to find the first negative number.
Example Input:
numbers = [3, 5, 7, -2, 4]
Output:
First negative: -2

7. Check if a Number is Prime
Write a `while` loop to check if a number is prime.
Example Input:
n = 7
Output:
True

8. Factorial Calculation
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.
Example Input:
n = 5
Output:
Factorial: 120

9. Generate Fibonacci Sequence
